# mbed-os-example-blinky_STM32F407VE
mbed on STM32F407 with AdafruitGFX for ILI9341

This is a project for a STM32F407VE board with TFT display, both from ACELEX (cheap boards from Aliexpress).
The ACELEX board is not in the original mbed repo yet.

Build with mbed library as base. This project is working but in a very rough state. 
It is working with Eclipse and the GNU Arm eclipse plugin.
